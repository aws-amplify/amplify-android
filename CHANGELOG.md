[See all changes between 2.1.0 and 2.0.0](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/compare/release_v2.0.0...release_v2.1.0)

## [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/releases/tag/release_v2.0.0)

###Breaking Changes

#### Android SDK
- Support for **Android SDK API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat) and higher**

#### Escape Hatches
- Escape Hatches provide access to AWS SDK for Kotlin instead of `AWSMobileClient` from AWS SDK for Android.

#### Auth
- `signIn` now returns result with `isSignedIn` instead of `isSignInComplete`
- `confirmResetPassword` API takes additional `username` parameter.
- `signOut` now takes single `onComplete` parameter instead of `onSuccess` and `onError`.
- `fetchAuthSession` now returns `identityIdResult` instead of `identityId`.
- `getCurrentUser` API is now asynchronous and requires `onSuccess` and `onError` parameters. `AuthUser` is returned in `onSuccess`
- The escape hatch now provides access to the underlying `CognitoIdentityProviderClient` and `CognitoIdentityClient` instance.
- Parameters `signInQueryParameters`, `signOutQueryParameters`, and `tokenQueryParameters` are dropped from `AuthWebUISignInOptions`.
- `federationProviderName` has been dropped from `AWSCognitoAuthWebUISignInOptions`.
- `signIn` will now return an error if you attempt to call sign in, while already signed in.

### Features
Replace underlying AWS SDK with AWS SDK for Kotlin.

#### Auth
- Federate to Identity Pool
- Custom auth flow now supports without SRP flow
- Supports user migration flow
- Force refresh token.

#### Storage
- Add support to query local enqueued transfers.

### Miscellaneous
- All the categories use the same version number
