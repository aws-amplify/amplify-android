-------------------------------------------------------

The Amplify Android library is AWS' preferred mechanism for interacting
with AWS services from an Android device.

The library provides a high-level interface to perform different
**categories** of cloud operations. Each category may be fulfilled by a
**plugin**, which you configure during setup.

The default plugins that we provide are designed to facilitate
interaction with Amazon Web Services (AWS). But, the Amplify Framework
is designed to be extensible to any other backend or service.

To familiarize yourself with Amplify, checkout our [Getting Started
Guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/android).

\* Predictions utilizes a range of Amazon's Machine Learning services,

Textract, and Amazon Translate.

All services and features not listed above are supported via the [Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-kotlin) or if supported by a category can be accessed via the Escape Hatch like below:

### Kotlin

```kotlin
val s3StoragePlugin = Amplify.Storage.getPlugin("awsS3StoragePlugin")
val s3Client = s3StoragePlugin.escapeHatch as S3Client
```

### Java

```java
AWSS3StoragePlugin plugin = (AWSS3StoragePlugin) Amplify.Storage.getPlugin("awsS3StoragePlugin");
S3Client s3Client = plugin.getEscapeHatch();
```

## Platform Support

The Amplify Framework supports Android API level 24 (Android 7.0) and above.

## Using Amplify from Your App

For step-by-step setup instructions, checkout our [Project Setup
guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/android).

### Specifying Gradle Dependencies

To begin, include Amplify from your `app` module's `build.gradle`
dependencies section:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Only specify modules that provide functionality your app will use
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-analytics-pinpoint:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-datastore:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-predictions:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-geo-location:2.5.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-push-notifications-pinpoint:2.5.0'
}
```

### Java 8 Requirement

Amplify Android _requires_ Java 8 features. Please add a `compileOptions`
block inside your app's `build.gradle`, as below:

```gradle
android {
    compileOptions {
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```
In the same file, add core library desugaring in your `dependencies`
block:
```gradle
dependencies {
    // Add this line
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.0.10'
}
```

### Kotlin & Rx Support

Amplify's default interface renders results through async callbacks. We also provide optional, adapter APIs which better integrate with RxJava and Kotlin:

 - [Using RxJava with Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/rxjava/q/platform/android)
 - [Kotlin Coroutines Support](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/coroutines/q/platform/android)
