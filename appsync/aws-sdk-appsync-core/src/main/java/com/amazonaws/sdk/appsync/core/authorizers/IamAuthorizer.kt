 * [AppSyncAuthorizer] implementation that uses IAM policies for authorization. This authorizer delegates to the

 * The signature generation should use AWS SigV4 signing. There is an implementation of this signing logic in the
 * apollo-appsync-amplify library, or you can use the AWS SDK for Kotlin, or any other SigV4 implementation.
 * @param generateSignatureHeaders The delegate that performs the signing. It should return all of the SigV4 headers
 * necessary for a signed request.
