     * This function that creates a {@link Consumer} which wraps the {@link ObservableEmitter#onError(Throwable)}
     * to prevent it from calling observers that have already been disposed.
     *
     * <p>
     * The scenario is that we have multiple event sources (1 AppSync subscription
     * for each model+operation type combination) being consumed by a single downstream
     * oberserver. Once the first subscription emits an error, the downstream subscriber
     * is placed in a disposed state and will not receive any further notifications.
     * In a situation such as loss of connectivity, it's innevitable that multiple subscriptions will fail.
     * With that said, after the first failure, the other events sources (AppSync subscriptions)
     * will attempt to invoke the downstream onError handler which then results in an
     * {@link io.reactivex.exceptions.UndeliverableException} being thrown.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * This method takes a reference of the observable that represents the AppSync subscription,
     * wraps it and returns a {@link Consumer} that is used as the onError parameter. The returned
     * {@link Consumer} function will delegate the onError call to the downstream observers if it's
     * still available, otherwise it logs a warning.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param realEmitter The emitter which will have it's onError function proxied by the return
     *                    value of this function.
     * @param <T> The type of model handled by the emitter.
     * @param <E> The type of exception for the onError consumer
     * @return A {@link Consumer} that proxies the {@link ObservableEmitter#onError(Throwable)} call
     * to the {@code realEmitter} if it's not disposed or logs a warning.
     * @see <a href="https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/issues/541">GitHub issue #541</a>
