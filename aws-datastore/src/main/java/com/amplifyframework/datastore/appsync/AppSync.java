/**
 * Client interface for an AppSync service endpoint.
 *
 * Specifically, an AppSync client expects that the AppSync endpoint:
 *
 *   1. May be queried via base/delta sync queries, to understand the current states of
 *      the data warehoused on the AppSync endpoint. The logic to perform a base or a
 *      delta query is managed by business rules around the last sync time;
 *
 *   2. Supports create, update, delete mutations, to modify the state of any data
 *      that is warehoused at the endpoint. These operations consider a unique ID for
 *      each model instance, as well as a monotonically increasing version for every
 *      model instance warehoused at the endpoint;
 *
 *   3. Can host subscriptions, over which a client may receive notifications when any
 *      of the above AppSync mutations have been performed on a particular model(s);
