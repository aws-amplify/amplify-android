/**
 * This utility class will inspect the JVM's Class loader to find a class named
 * "com.amplifyframework.datastore.generated.model.AmplifyModelProvider". This is the package
 * and class name that the Amplify CLI Code Generator tool uses when creating an {@link ModelProvider}
 * instance to be consumed inside of the user's consuming application. This class, by contract,
 * has public-access static method named `getInstance()` which returns ModelProvider.
 *
 * There is no compile-time guarantee that this class actually exists, or that it has that method,
 * or that we can use that method. But in the "happy path," this simplifies the amount of complexity
 * needed to begin using the DataStore. This utility class is used from
