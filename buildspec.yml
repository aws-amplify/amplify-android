# This file is used as part of the build process implemented using AWS CodeBuild [1].
# The CodeBuild documentation [2] provides an introduction of the service and its capabilities. In general
# terms, it allows us to configure the actions executed when a build is triggered by a commit to the
# amplify-android GitHub repository.
