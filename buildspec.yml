# This file is used as part of the build process implemented using AWS CodeBuild [1].
# The CodeBuild documentation [2] provides an introduction of the service and its capabilities. In general
# terms, it allows us to configure the actions executed when a build is triggered by a commit to the
# amplify-android GitHub repository.
#
# For the purposes of this repo, we're simply running a build by using "./gradlew build"
# command and in the post-build phase, we consolidate the JUnit report files in one location.
# In the reports section, we're instructing CodeBuild to publish those reports which can be
# viewed in the AWS CodeBuild console (Future work will be to publish those to Github for easier access).
